	<section>
	<h1>Examples</h1>
	<p> Knitting is very versatile, and not just for warm scarves, hats, and sweaters. I personally have two knit shirts that can be worn in warm weather. 
			Although I do tend to end up knitting cozy accessories, blankets, pillows, and stuffed toys frequently make their way into my knitting queue.
			I have also become very fond of knitting socks, which make excellent gifts. The following are a few of my favorite projects, which I hope will 
			give you an idea of the flexibility of the craft and how yarn choice can affect the look and behavior of your project. </p>
<!--Beginning of the scrollmagic slides-->
	<!--Project: Slade Cardigan-->
		<div class="wrapper"  id="slade">
		<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="sladetext" class="text">
					<h4>Slade</h4>
					<p>This may be my favorite thing I have ever knit. 
				I saved up for the yarn for a while, and it took me nearly a year and a half
				to knit because I had to start over two or three times due to absentminded mistakes. 
				This sweater got dragged around all kinds of places with me and has a bunch of 
				memories attached to it. I finished it just in time for my vacation to Colorado 
				last year and then added pockets once I got back. I wear it around the house any 
				chance I can get, and it is my default movie theater sweater. </p>

		<!--Project: Capra Socks-->
		<div class="wrapper" id ="capra">
		<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="capratext" class="text">
				<h4>Cabled Socks</h4>
				<p>I designed and knit these so I could have some socks to wear in my snow boots during 
					my Colorado trip. I mostly just wore them while knitting by the fireplace and making baked goods. 
					These have the distinction of being the only thing that I have ever knit by candlelight, as I was working
					on them when Hurricane Matthew was pummeling Saint Augustine. These are knit from a cashmere blend 
					and are my preferred socks to wear around the house. As an aside, socks are not nearly as hard to knit as they seem.</p>

		<!--Project Harbor Sweater-->
		<div class="wrapper" id ="harbor">
		<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="harbortext" class="text">
				<h4>Baby Sweater</h4>
				<p>I knit this this little cardigan for a friend’s baby from a heavily modified pattern. 
					Even though it had so many tiny stitches I really enjoyed knitting it 
					and it didn’t take nearly as long as I had thought it would. I used a cashmere blend 
					so it is very soft and warm. In fact, it's simply a lighter weight of the same exact yarn as my socks.
					It was knit completely flat from the bottom up and then seamed, which worked much better than I thought it would.

		<!--Project: Mitts-->
		<div class="wrapper" id ="mitts">	
		<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="mittstext" class="text">
				<h4>Fingerless Mitts</h4>
				<p>Initially, I designed and knit these as a birthday gift for one 
				of my sisters (the grey version), but I ended up liking them so much 
				that I knit another version from a yarn that shows off the stitch 
				pattern better and is more hard wearing. The palms are textured so 
				that they produce a little bit more grip. Both versions use an alpaca blend, 
				so they are nice and soft.</p>

		<!--Project: Octopus-->

		<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="octotext" class="text">
				<h4>Dumbo Octopus</h4>	
				<p>This one is another favorite, which was made as a Christmas gift for my nephew. 
					It is a heavily modified version of <a href="https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2013/05/19/whits-knits-knit-octopus/" title="Knit Octopus Pattern">this pattern</a> made to 
					look like a dumbo octopus. The umbrella-like portion took a few attempts 
					and a lot of guessing to get right. The bottom sides of the little tentacles 
					are even textured to look like suckers.</p>

		<!--Project: Blanket Animals-->
		<div class="wrapper" id ="animals">
			<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="animaltext" class="text">
				<h4>Blanket Animals</h4>
				<p>Over the past year or so I have ended up knitting a 
					small variety of these little guys. The bunnies were the first ones I attempted. 
					The current roster also includes lambs, foxes, deer, and an elephant.
					I currently have a cat in the works. The heads are knit 
					like modified sock heels, and to get the faces to look right I 
					always start by studying and sketching the skull of the animal I 
					am working on.</p>

		<!--Project: Vault-->
		<div class="wrapper" id ="vault">
			<!--Project Text-->
			<div id="vaulttext" class="text">
				<h4>Vault</h4>
				<p>The first version of this hat is pretty much the only one I wear during 
				Florida’s very limited winter. It was one of the first things I designed 
				from scratch and it took me a while to work out how to get it to look the 
				way I wanted. There are four columns of garter stitch that come together 
				near the crown to imitate a gothic vault. The second version doesn’t have 
				the alpaca content of the first, so it is a bit more structured and shows off 
				the pattern a bit better. </p>
