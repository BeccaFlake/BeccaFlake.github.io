						    These always end up being favorites for me. Credit for getting me into making 
						them goes to my older sister, who frequently comissions new ones from me as baby gifts.
						Anytime I design a new animal I start by referencing and sketching the skull. Knowing what 
						the skull looks like allows me to build on top of it and work out the best way to recreate 
						the animal's head. 
					</p>
					<p>
						    The blue and pink rabbits were the first ones I ever made, and occupy a special place in my
							heart. Requests for bunnies always get me excited. The elephants also ended up being one
							of my favorites, as did the giraffe! The giraffe's little horns were a fun callange to implement.
							They all also remind me of the Pokemon Shuppet, which happens to be one of my favorites, 
							so I have a bias towards them.

						One of these day’s I’ll make a matching hat for it. </p></div>

						<h3>Slade</h3></a><p>One of my most beloved and worn knits, I coveted Slade for years before
						I made it. It took me three tries to get right, due to me not paying attention, but I adore it and the 
						addition of pockets makes it basically perfect. It's just warm enough for cold days, but isn't overwhalming

						<h3>Yishu</h3></a><p>Yishu was another pattern I wanted to make forever. The stars finally aligned 
						when my brother get me the yarn for Christmas. I've worn it a few times and really should wear it more. It isn't 
						super warm, so I can feasibly wear it in Florida when it isn't 90 degrees out.</p></div>

						<h3>Cabeled Baby Vest</h3></a><p> This little vest is a gift for an expecting friend.
 						Something I really wanted to try with it was having the cable wrap up around the back of the neck as one piece. 
						The shoulders are grafted together and then the cable continues around the back while picking up along the 
						bound off edge to attach it. It also happens to be the the first sweater I've actually written the pattern for.</p></div>
